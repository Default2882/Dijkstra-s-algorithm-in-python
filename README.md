# Djikstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path from a source vertex to a destination vertex.

## Time complexity - O(m * n)

Here, m is the number of the edges in the graph and n is the number of vertices in the graph.

## Worst time complexity - O(n^2)

This is because the maximun number of edges a single vertex can have is n-1.
